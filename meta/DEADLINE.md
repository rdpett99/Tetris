## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the app
> category that you chose, and the primary functions available to users
> of the app.

This app is a version of the arcade game Tetris. The user is able to move
shapes on the scene, turn shapes, pause/play/quit/restart the game, and the
game keeps track of the user's score and the number of lines cleared.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

I've never made a game before! This was very exciting for me to make, and
I'm very proud of the outcome. This project taught me a lot about the
javafx.scene.layout.Rectangle class as it required me to move a lot of
moving pieces on the board! I also learned about the Timer and TimerTask
classes in order to make my game function on a basis of time.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

If I could do this project over, I'd create a more detailed plan.
I started off with something completely different than what I ended
up with, however that is because I learned a lot along the way while
completing this project. I am happy with the outcome.
